# DaMemoryGame
Here's a Preview of a Game I'm working on written in Python.

i = "Welcome to Da Memory Game..."
g = "This game will help you remember things..."
d = i + " " + g 
print(d) 

name = input("What is your name ? : ")
print("Hello " + name) 
print("Let's Start...") 

who = input("Who was the 45th President on the United States? : ") 
print("That's Correct " + name) 
print("Great Work !!") 

def last():
    print("Thanks for Playing Da Memory Game !!") 
last()
